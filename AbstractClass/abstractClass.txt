Abstract class is a class with one or more abstract methods.
Abstract method is a method signature without implementation.
Abstract class cannot be instantiated and should be extended and implemented in subclasses.
ex: A a = new A(); //is wrong!!
Ex:
public abstract class GeometricObject{
    private String color = 'white';
    private boolean filled;
    private java.util.Date dateCreated;

    protected GeometricObject() {
        dateCreated = new java.util.Date();
    }
    public abstract double getArea();
    public abstract double getPerimeter();
}
public class Rectangle extends GeometricObject{
    public double getArea() {return width*height;}
    public double getPerimeter() {return 2*(width+height);}
}
**An abstract method cannot be contained in a non-abstract class.
**An abstract class cannot be instantiated but can declare constructor in its subclasses.
**A subclass can be abstract even if its superclass is concrete.
**Can crete array due to abstract class can be used as a data type.
GeometricObject[] geo = new GeometricObject[10];// THIS IS CORRECT
geo[0] = new Circle();
geo[1] = new Rectangle();
