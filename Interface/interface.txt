using implemments to extend a parent class 
all variables must be public static final 
No constructors.
An interface cannot be instantiated using the new operator.
All methods must be public abstract instance methods. 
ex:
public interface InterfaceName{
    constant declaration;->public static final
    method declaration;[all methods are abstract!!]
}

EX:
public interface Conversionfactors {
    //all are constants
    double inToMm =25.3; 
    public final int aConstant =32;
    double ounToGram = 28.34952;
    public double inToMm();//no nid to include abstract

EX2:
public interface Speakable{
 public String speak();
}
public class Cat extends Animal implements Speakable{
    public Cat(){kind="cat";}
    public String speak(){
        return "meow";
    }
}
